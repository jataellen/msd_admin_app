-- Comprehensive script to fix timeline issues
-- 1. Fix duplicate workflow_status_change events
-- 2. Fix incorrect years (2025 â†’ 2024)
-- 3. Ensure proper chronological order

-- First, identify and remove duplicate workflow_status_change events
-- Keep only the first occurrence of each status change
